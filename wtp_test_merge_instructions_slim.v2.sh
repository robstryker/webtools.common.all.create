# make a new folder and put this file inside it. 
# Then execute it. 
#
# This script rewrites history for each of the four repositories, 
# specifically, to make ALL commits of the repos believe they were 
# always in a subfolder of the repository. 
#  Examples:
#  - pom.xml from webtools.common repo is rewritten to believe it always
#    lived inside webtools.common.all repo at webtools.common/pom.xml   
#    (ie rewrote all history so pom.xml always was webtools.common/pom.xml)
#  - pom.xml from webtools.common.tests repo is rewritten to believe it always
#    lived inside webtools.common.all repo at webtools.common.tests/pom.xml
#    (ie rewrote all history so pom.xml always was webtools.common.tests/pom.xml)
# etc etc etc. 
#
# This changes all hashes of all previous commits, tags, branches, etc
# but keeps them otherwise identical.
# 
# The script then backs up these 4 rewritten repos to a temporary folder
# named 'intermediary' for use later in the script. 
# 
# The script then rebuilds all branches and tags for a merged repo.
# This is a bit of a challenge, because the different repos may share,
# or not share, a given tag or branch name. In the event two repos
# share a branch or tag id, we should merge those two together. 
# 
# It would be near impossible, short of going commit-by-commit, 
# to re-create all 4 repos at the time of a given tag that exists
# only in one repo, so for such branches or tags, we keep just 1
# of the repos in that given tag. 
#
# However, this would cause the root of the repo to change repeatedly
# from having subfolders to not having subfolders, and this would be
# disruptive or confusing to the user. 
# Ex:
#  - repo at master: 'ls' returns webtools.common  webtools.common.fproj  webtools.common.snippets  webtools.common.tests
#  - user does git checkout for branch name 'TEMP_M4'
#  - 'ls' now returns 'plugins' only.  
# 
# This is a problem, because the user won't know (without inspection)
# which pre-merge repo this tag or branch existed in... basically, 
# they won't know what they're browsing. The main directory structure
# with 4 subdirs should be maintained in all tags and branches ideally. 
# So this script accomplishes that goal, at the expense of 
# changing hashes, and rewriting history to make the files
# think they always lived in subfolders. 
#
# I hope this isn't too much of a drawback. It will most likely
# invalidate a lot of PRs that haven't been accepted yet :( 
# So that's definitely a problem. 
#
# The script takes about a half hour +/- 10min to run.
